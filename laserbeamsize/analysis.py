"""
A module for finding the beam size in an monochrome image.

Full documentation is available at <https://laserbeamsize.readthedocs.io>

Simple and fast calculation of beam sizes from a single monochrome image based
on the ISO 11146 method of variances.  Some effort has been made to make
the algorithm automatically handle background noise.

Finding the center and diameters of a beam in a monochrome image is simple::

    >>> import imageio.v3 as iio
    >>> import laserbeamsize as lbs
    >>>
    >>> file = "https://github.com/scottprahl/laserbeamsize/raw/main/docs/t-hene.pgm"
    >>> image = iio.imread(file)
    >>>
    >>> x, y, d_major, d_minor, phi = lbs.beam_size(image)
    >>> print("The center of the beam ellipse is at (%.0f, %.0f)" % (x, y))
    >>> print("The ellipse major diameter is %.0f pixels" % d_major)
    >>> print("The ellipse minor diameter is %.0f pixels" % d_minor)
    >>> print("The major axis of the ellipse is rotated %.0f° ccw from the horizontal" % (phi * 180/3.1416))

    Determine the beam center, diameters, and tilt using ISO 11146 standard.

    Find the center and sizes of an elliptical spot in an 2D array.

    The function does nothing to eliminate background noise.  It just finds the first
    and second order moments and returns the beam parameters. Consequently
    a beam spot in an image with a constant background will fail badly.

    FWIW, this implementation is roughly 800X faster than one that finds
    the moments using for loops.

    When background noise dominates then a diameter of 1 is returned.

    phi_fixed defaults to None, in which case the best fitted angle for the
    ellipse is found.  If phi_fixed is specified, then an ellipse is rotated to
    that angle and fitted to the image.

    Determine beam parameters in an image with noise.

    The function first estimates the elliptical spot by excluding all points
    that are less than the average value found in the corners of the image.

    These beam parameters are then used to determine a rectangle that surrounds
    the elliptical spot.  The rectangle size is `mask_diameters` times the spot
    diameters.  This is the integration region used for estimate a new beam
    spot.

    This process is repeated until two successive spot sizes match again as
    outlined in ISO 11146

    `corner_fraction` determines the size of the corners. ISO 11146-3
    recommends values from 2-5%.  The default value of 3.5% works pretty well.

    `mask_diameters` is the size of the rectangular mask in diameters
    of the ellipse.  ISO 11146 states that `mask_diameters` should be 3.
    This default value works fine.

    `nT` accounts for noise in the background.  The background is estimated
    using the values in the corners of the image as `mean+nT * stdev`. ISO 11146
    states that `2<nT<4`.  The default value works fine.

    `max_iter` is the maximum number of iterations done before giving up.

    Args:
        image: 2D array of image of beam
        mask_diameters: (optional) the size of the integration rectangle in diameters
        corner_fraction: (optional) the fractional size of the corners
        nT: (optional) the multiple of background noise to remove
        max_iter: (optional) maximum number of iterations.
